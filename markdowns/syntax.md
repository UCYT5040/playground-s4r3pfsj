# Creating A Syntax

In english, syntax means the following:
> the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language.
This is very simiar in programming. A syntax is the arrangment of symbols to form a programming language.

## The Syntax For Our Language

I've come up with a syntax for this language.

Here is an example of it in action.
```
print>hello
set>a>hello
print?{a} world
set>b>world
print>{a} {b}
```

Basically, you put the function, then `>`, then any paramaters.
If a `>` isn't present it will run normally.
